# TV Script Generator

This repo contains my work for the TV Script Generation project, part of the Udacity Deep Learning course.

Before using this repository you will need to install:
- Jupyter

You can then open the notebook and follow along.
At the end of the notebook is a function to generate scripts from my trained model.
